# CodSoft Internship Projects

This repository contains the projects I completed during my internship at **CodSoft**. These projects are focused on **Data Science** and showcase my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and Python development.

## Projects Overview

### 1. **Titanic Survival Prediction**
   - **Objective**: Predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning techniques.
   - **Tools Used**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
   - **Algorithms**: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest
   - **Summary**: This project applies data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation to accurately predict passenger survival. I experimented with different algorithms to compare their performance.

### 2. **Movie Rating Prediction**
   - **Objective**: Predict movie ratings based on user behavior and preferences.
   - **Tools Used**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Surprise
   - **Algorithms**: Collaborative Filtering, Matrix Factorization
   - **Summary**: A recommendation system project that leverages collaborative filtering techniques to predict user ratings of movies. I worked on improving the accuracy of the model by tuning hyperparameters.

### 3. **Credit Card Fraud Detection**
   - **Objective**: Identify fraudulent credit card transactions from a dataset of transactions.
   - **Tools Used**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
   - **Algorithms**: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting
   - **Summary**: This project focuses on identifying fraudulent transactions using a variety of classification techniques. The dataset is highly imbalanced, and techniques such as SMOTE were applied to address the imbalance.
